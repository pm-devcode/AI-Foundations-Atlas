# Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

## Overview
Graph Neural Networks are designed to process data that is best represented as a graph (nodes and edges), such as social networks, molecular structures, or knowledge graphs. Standard neural networks expect fixed-size vectors or grids (images), whereas GNNs can handle irregular graph structures.

## Key Categories

### 1. Graph Convolution
Generalizing the convolution operation to graphs.
*   **GCN (Graph Convolutional Network)**: A spectral approach to graph convolution, aggregating information from immediate neighbors.

### 2. Graph Attention
Applying attention mechanisms to graphs.
*   **GAT (Graph Attention Network)**: Learning to weigh the importance of different neighbors dynamically, rather than treating them all equally.
