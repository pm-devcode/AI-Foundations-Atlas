# Time Series Analysis

## Overview
**Time Series Analysis** involves methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. **Time Series Forecasting** is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.

## Key Concepts
1.  **Trend**: A long-term increase or decrease in the data.
2.  **Seasonality**: A pattern that repeats at regular intervals (e.g., daily, monthly).
3.  **Stationarity**: A property where the statistical properties of the series (mean, variance) do not change over time. Many models (like ARIMA) require the data to be stationary.
4.  **Autocorrelation**: The correlation of a series with a delayed copy of itself.

## Directory Structure
*   **Statistical**: Traditional statistical methods.
    *   `ARIMA`: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average.
*   **Deep_Learning**: Modern neural network approaches.
    *   `LSTM_TimeSeries`: Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequence prediction.

## Applications
*   **Finance**: Stock price prediction, algorithmic trading.
*   **Weather**: Temperature and precipitation forecasting.
*   **Energy**: Electricity demand forecasting.
*   **Sales**: Inventory planning and revenue projection.
