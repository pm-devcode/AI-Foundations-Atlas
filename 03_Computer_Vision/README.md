# Computer Vision

## Overview
Computer Vision is the field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs. This section explores how we moved from hand-crafted features to end-to-end learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Key Categories

### 1. Convolutional Networks (CNN)
*   **Basic CNN**: Understanding Convolutions, Pooling, and Stride. How networks learn spatial hierarchies of features (edges -> textures -> objects).

### 2. Object Detection
Locating objects within an image and classifying them.
*   **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: A unified architecture that frames object detection as a regression problem, enabling real-time detection.

### 3. Segmentation
Classifying every single pixel in an image.
*   **U-Net**: A fully convolutional network developed for biomedical image segmentation, known for its U-shaped architecture with skip connections.

### 4. Architectures
Famous backbone networks that advanced the state of the art.
*   **ResNet (Residual Networks)**: Introducing skip connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem, allowing for training of very deep networks (100+ layers).
