# Graph Neural Networks

## Overview
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning methods designed to perform inference on data described by graphs. They provide a way to handle non-Euclidean data structures like social networks, molecular structures, and knowledge graphs.

## Key Categories

### Graph Attention
Mechanisms that allow the model to weigh the importance of different neighbor nodes.
*   **GAT (Graph Attention Network)**: Uses attention mechanisms to learn the relative weights between two connected nodes.

### Graph Convolution
Generalizing the convolution operation from grid data (images) to graph data.
*   **GCN_Spectral (Graph Convolutional Network)**: A semi-supervised learning approach on graph-structured data based on an efficient variant of Convolutional Neural Networks.
