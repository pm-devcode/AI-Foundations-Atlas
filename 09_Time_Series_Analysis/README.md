# Time Series Analysis

## Overview
Time Series Analysis involves methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. It is widely used in forecasting, signal processing, and econometrics.

## Key Categories

### Deep Learning
Using neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies.
*   **LSTM_TimeSeries**: Long Short-Term Memory networks are well-suited for classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data.

### Statistical
Traditional statistical methods for modeling and forecasting.
*   **ARIMA**: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average is a class of models that explains a given time series based on its own past values, that is, its own lags and the lagged forecast errors.
