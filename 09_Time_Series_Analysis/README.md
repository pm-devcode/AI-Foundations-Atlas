# Time Series Analysis

## Overview
Time Series Analysis involves methods for analyzing time-ordered data points to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. It is widely used in finance, weather forecasting, and supply chain management.

## Key Categories

### 1. Statistical Methods
Traditional approaches based on statistical properties like autocorrelation and stationarity.
*   **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A powerful statistical model that combines Autoregression (AR), Differencing (I), and Moving Average (MA) components.

### 2. Deep Learning Methods
Using neural networks to capture complex non-linear dependencies in time.
*   **LSTM for Time Series**: Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory networks to forecast future values based on long historical sequences.
