# Project Specifications: AI-Foundations-Atlas

## 1. Project Philosophy & Mission
**Name:** AI-Foundations-Atlas
**Core Mission:** To demystify Artificial Intelligence by peeling back the layers of abstraction.
**Motto:** "Don't just import it. Implement it."

This is **not** a collection of production-ready snippets. It is an **interactive textbook**.

* **The "Why" over the "How":** We prioritize understanding *why* a gradient is calculated a certain way over finding the fastest NumPy vectorization.
* **History Matters:** Algorithms didn't appear in a vacuum. We must honor the context, the inventors, and the computational limitations of their time.
* **White Box Approach:** We treat algorithms as "White Boxes" (fully transparent) in the scratch implementation to expose the internal mechanics, contrasting them with the "Black Boxes" of modern frameworks.

## 2. Language & Tone
* **Language:** Strictly **English**. All documentation, comments, variable names, and commit messages must be in English.
* **Tone:** Academic yet accessible. Imagine a passionate professor explaining a complex concept to a bright student.
* **Clarity:** Avoid jargon where possible. If jargon is necessary, define it immediately in plain English.

## 3. Directory Structure & File Roles

### A. Category Documentation
Every main category folder (e.g., `09_Time_Series_Analysis`) must contain a `README.md` file.
*   **Purpose:** To provide a high-level overview of the domain (e.g., "What is Time Series Analysis?").
*   **Content:** Key concepts shared across all sub-modules, historical timeline of the field, and a roadmap of the contained algorithms.

### B. Case Study Structure
Every "Case Study" folder (e.g., `01_Linear_Regression_Simple`) is a self-contained module. It must contain the following specific files/folders with strict roles:

#### 1. `assets/` (Visual Assets)
*   **Role:** Stores all static images used in `README.md`.
*   **Source:** Images must be generated by code (Python scripts) or defined as Mermaid diagrams. Avoid manual screenshots or binary blobs if possible.

#### 2. `README.md` (The Textbook)
This is the heart of the module. A student should be able to read this and understand the concept **without** looking at the code.

**Required Sections:**
1.  **Executive Summary:** What is this algorithm? What problem does it solve?
2.  **Historical Context:**
    * **Who** invented it? (Names, Dates).
    * **The Context:** Was this a breakthrough? Did it cause an "AI Winter"?
    * **Seminal Papers:** Citations and links to original papers (ArXiv/JSTOR).
3.  **Real-World Analogy:** A non-technical explanation (e.g., "Gradient Descent is like walking down a mountain in thick fog").
4.  **Mathematical Foundation:**
    * Rigorous definition of the Model, Loss Function, and Optimizer.
    * **LaTeX** must be used for all formulas (e.g., $$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} \sum ...$$).
    * Step-by-step derivation of the gradients (crucial for the scratch implementation).
5.  **Architecture Diagram:** A `mermaid` flowchart showing the data flow.
6.  **References:** List of books, articles, and courses used.

#### 3. `00_scratch.py` (The Educational Core)
* **Constraint:** ONLY `numpy`, `pandas`, `math`, `matplotlib`. **NO** frameworks (Torch/TF/Scikit-Learn models).
* **The "Literate Coding" Rule:** Comments should account for **30-50%** of the file lines.
    * *Bad Comment:* `# Update weights`
    * *Good Comment:* `# We update the weights by moving against the gradient direction. The learning rate (lr) controls the step size to prevent overshooting the local minimum.`
* **Variable Naming:** Must mirror the math in `README.md`. If the LaTeX formula uses $\theta$ or $\hat{y}$, the code should use `theta` or `y_hat`.

#### 4. `01_tensorflow.py` & `02_pytorch.py` (The Modern Contrast)
* **Goal:** To demonstrate how hundreds of lines of NumPy code condense into a few lines of framework code.
* **Commentary:** Focus on mapping the "Scratch" concepts to the Framework API.
    * *Example:* "Here, `loss.backward()` automatically performs the chain rule derivatives we manually calculated in the scratch file."

## 4. Visual Standards (Code-First Approach)
We avoid manual drawings. All visuals should be reproducible via code.

*   **Static Assets:** All generated images must be saved to the `assets/` folder within the module.
*   **Graphs (Python):**
    *   Every `00_scratch.py` must generate and save key visualizations (e.g., `assets/loss_curve.png`, `assets/decision_boundary.png`).
    *   *Regression:* Show the regression line fitting the data points.
    *   *Classification:* Show the decision boundary.
    *   *Training:* Always show a "Loss vs Epochs" chart.
*   **Diagrams (Mermaid):**
    *   Use **Mermaid.js** code blocks in `README.md` for architectures, flowcharts, and sequence diagrams.
    *   *Benefit:* These render automatically on GitHub and are version-controllable text.
*   **Concept Visualization:**
    *   If a complex mathematical concept needs visualization (e.g., "Sigmoid Derivative"), create a separate script `viz_concepts.py` that generates the image into `assets/`.

## 5. Content Generation Checklist (For LLMs)
When generating content for this repository, the AI Agent must ensure:

1.  [ ] **History Check:** Did I mention the year, the author, and the historical significance?
2.  [ ] **Math Check:** Are the LaTeX formulas accurate, rendered correctly, and consistent with the code variables?
3.  [ ] **Comment Check:** Are the comments in `00_scratch.py` verbose, educational, and explanatory (not just descriptive)?
4.  [ ] **Analogy Check:** Did I include a concrete real-world comparison?
5.  [ ] **English Check:** Is the English natural, professional, and free of grammatical errors?
